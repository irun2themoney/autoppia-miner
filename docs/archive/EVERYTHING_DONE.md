## 🚀 What Happens Next (Automatic)

1. **Validators scan network** → They discover your axon (UID 160)
2. **They send test tasks** → Your miner processes them
3. **You appear on IWAP** → After first successful task
4. **Performance tracking begins** → Dashboard shows metrics
5. **You climb rankings** → Based on your superior features

**Timeline**: 5-30 minutes typical

## 📋 Quick Reference

# 📊 Playground Performance Analysis

**Date**: November 22, 2025

## 🎯 Understanding Playground vs. Validator Tests

### **Key Insight**
The playground benchmark uses the **same evaluation system** as validators. If you're getting 0% success on the playground, validators will also see 0% success.

## 🏆 Top Miner Performance

### **Dynamic Zero Context**

**Winner Takes All (WTA)**:
- Only the **top miner** per evaluation cycle gets the full reward
- This means competition is **extremely intense**
- Most miners likely have **partial success**, not 100%

**Dynamic IWA (D1-D4)**:
- **D1**: Randomized HTML layouts
- **D2**: Real-time data (fresh every session)
- **D3**: Text & label variations
- **D4**: Interactive pop-ups mid-task

**Impact**: Makes memorization impossible. Even top miners struggle with:
- Adapting to layout changes
- Handling unexpected pop-ups
- Reasoning through dynamic content

## 📊 Expected Success Rates

### **SOTA Baselines** (Reference Points)
- **OpenAI CUA**: Evaluated in every round
- **Anthropic CUA**: Evaluated in every round
- **Browser Use**: Evaluated in every round

These are used as **benchmarks**, not competitors (they can't earn rewards).

### **Realistic Expectations**

**Top Miners**:
- Likely have **30-70% success rate** (not 100%)
- May excel at specific task types
- Struggle with Dynamic Zero's unpredictability

**Average Miners**:
- May have **10-30% success rate**
- Some tasks work, others fail
- Need improvement in adaptation

**Your Current Status**:
- **0% success** = Empty actions issue (now fixed)
- After fix: Expect **some success**, but not 100%
- Focus on **improving incrementally**

---

## 🔍 Why Success Rates Are Low

### **1. Dynamic Zero Difficulty**
- Tasks change every session
- Can't memorize patterns
- Must reason and adapt

### **2. Task Complexity**
- Multi-step tasks (login → action → verify)
- Complex selectors (dynamic IDs, changing text)
- Unexpected UI changes (pop-ups, modals)

### **3. Winner Takes All**
- Only top miner wins
- Creates intense competition
- Pushes toward best possible agents

---

## ✅ What "Passing" Means

### **Not 100% Success**
- Even top miners don't pass all tests
- "Passing" means **better than others**
- Focus on **relative performance**

### **Success Indicators**
- ✅ Non-empty actions (you have this now)
- ✅ Some tasks complete successfully
- ✅ Better than baseline models
- ✅ Improving over time

---

## 🎯 Your Path Forward

### **Immediate Goals**
1. ✅ **Fixed**: Empty actions issue
2. 🎯 **Next**: Get some tasks to succeed (even 10-20%)
3. 🎯 **Then**: Improve success rate incrementally

### **Realistic Targets**
- **Week 1**: 10-20% success rate
- **Week 2**: 20-40% success rate
- **Week 3**: 40-60% success rate
- **Top Tier**: 60-80% success rate

### **Focus Areas**
1. **Task Completion**: Ensure actions actually solve tasks
2. **Selector Accuracy**: Use better selectors
3. **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases
4. **Adaptation**: Respond to dynamic changes

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**Don't expect 100% success**. Even top miners struggle with Dynamic Zero. Focus on:
- ✅ Getting some tasks to work
- ✅ Improving incrementally
- ✅ Beating your previous scores
- ✅ Learning from failures

**The playground test is the same as validator tests** - if you improve on playground, you improve for validators!

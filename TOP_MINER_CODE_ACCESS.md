# 🔍 How to Review Top Miners' Code

**Date**: November 22, 2025

---

## ❓ The Question

**"Is there any way to review the top miners' code?"**

---

## 📋 Available Sources

### **1. Official Autoppia Template** ✅

**Repository**: https://github.com/autoppia/autoppia_web_agents_subnet

**What It Contains**:
- Official miner template
- Reference implementation
- Best practices
- Protocol definitions

**Use For**:
- Understanding official patterns
- Learning best practices
- Reference implementation

**Note**: This is the **template**, not top miners' actual code.

---

### **2. Public Miner Repositories** ⚠️

**Status**: **Most miners keep code private**

**Why**:
- Competitive advantage
- Proprietary strategies
- Don't want to share secrets

**However**, some miners might:
- Open source their code
- Share on GitHub
- Post in Discord

**How to Find**:
- Check Autoppia Discord for shared repos
- Search GitHub for "autoppia miner" or "subnet 36"
- Look for forks of official template

---

### **3. IWA Platform - Performance Data** ✅

**URL**: https://infinitewebarena.autoppia.com/subnet36/overview

**What You Can See**:
- ✅ Top miner rankings
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Success rates
- ✅ Task execution data
- ✅ Response times
- ❌ **Not their actual code**

**Use For**:
- Understanding what works
- Comparing performance
- Learning from metrics
- Seeing which strategies succeed

### **4. Bittensor Explorer** ⚠️

**URL**: https://taostats.io/subnets/36

**What You Can See**:
- Miner UIDs
- Stake amounts
- Network activity
- ❌ **Not their code**

---

## 🎯 What You CAN Learn

### **From IWA Platform**:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Success rates
   - Response times
   - Task completion rates
   - Website coverage

2. **Task Execution**:
   - How many actions they use
   - Which tasks they succeed at
   - Which websites they handle best

3. **Improvement Patterns**:
   - How they're improving over time
   - What strategies work
   - Which approaches fail

### **From Official Template**:

1. **Best Practices**:
   - Official patterns
   - Recommended approaches
   - Protocol compliance

2. **Reference Implementation**:
   - How to structure code
   - How to handle synapses
   - How to format responses

## 💡 Learning Strategies

### **1. Reverse Engineer from Performance** 🔍

**How**:
- Look at top miners' success rates
- See which tasks they excel at
- Analyze their action patterns
- Infer their strategies

**Example**:
- If top miner has 90% success on login tasks
- They likely have strong form field detection
- We should improve our form handling

### **2. Study Official Template** 📚

**How**:
- Read official template code
- Understand patterns
- See what Autoppia recommends
- Implement best practices

**Example**:
- Official template shows how to handle synapses
- We can learn from their approach
- Adapt to our implementation

### **3. Community Knowledge** 👥

**How**:
- Join Autoppia Discord
- Ask questions
- Share learnings
- Learn from discussions

**Example**:
- Discord might have code snippets
- Community shares strategies
- Learn from others' experiences

### **4. Experiment & Test** 🧪

**How**:
- Test different approaches
- Compare on playground
- Iterate based on results
- Learn what works

**Example**:
- Try different selector strategies
- Test browser automation
- Compare results
- Improve based on data

## 🚀 What We're Doing

### **Our Approach**:

1. **✅ Official Template**: Following official patterns
2. **✅ Browser Automation**: Real page analysis (our edge)
3. **✅ Dynamic Zero Compliance**: Adapting, not memorizing
4. **✅ Performance Monitoring**: Tracking our results

### **What We Can Learn**:

1. **From Top Miners' Metrics**:
   - What success rates are achievable
   - Which tasks are hardest
   - How to improve

2. **From Official Template**:
   - Best practices
   - Protocol compliance
   - Recommended patterns

3. **From Our Own Testing**:
   - What works for us
   - What doesn't work
   - How to improve

## 📋 Practical Steps

### **1. Monitor IWA Platform**:

```bash
# Check top miners regularly
# URL: https://infinitewebarena.autoppia.com/subnet36/overview
```

**Look for**:
- Top 3 miners' success rates
- Which tasks they excel at
- Their improvement trends

### **2. Study Official Template**:

```bash
# Clone official template
git clone https://github.com/autoppia/autoppia_web_agents_subnet
cd autoppia_web_agents_subnet
# Study the code
```

**Focus on**:
- How they handle synapses
- Action generation patterns
- Error handling

### **3. Join Community**:

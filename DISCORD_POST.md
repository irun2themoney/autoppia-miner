**Subject: Seeking Feedback - Miner UID 160 Getting Connections But Not Task Requests**

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm running miner **UID 160** on Subnet 36 and I'm looking for some feedback/advice.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **UID**: 160
- ✅ **Stake**: 75.48 TAO
- ✅ **Services**: Online and responding correctly
- ✅ **API**: Accessible at `134.199.203.133:8080`
- ✅ **Connections**: Receiving StartRoundSynapse connections regularly (validators are checking in)
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Not receiving actual task requests that get graded

**What I've Observed:**
- I'm getting StartRoundSynapse connections multiple times per day (validators are discovering me)
- I had successful task completions on Nov 14 with good performance
- My miner is responding correctly to all health checks
- All services are running stable (6+ days uptime)

**Questions:**
1. Is my 75.48 TAO stake sufficient, or should I be in a higher range to get regular task requests?
2. Are there any technical issues I should check that might prevent validators from sending tasks?
3. Is there anything else I can optimize to improve my chances of being selected?
4. What's the typical timeline for miners in my stake range to start receiving regular task requests?

I know validator selection is mostly automated, but any insights would be greatly appreciated! 🙏

Thanks in advance!

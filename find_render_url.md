# Finding Your Render URL

Your Render URL should be visible in your Render dashboard. Here's how to find it:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your service (autoppia-miner)
3. Look at the top - you'll see your URL like:
   - `https://autoppia-miner.onrender.com`
   - Or `https://autoppia-miner-xxxx.onrender.com`

Copy that URL and share it with me, or I can help you test it!

# 💰 Balance Increase Explanation

## 📊 **Your Balance Change**

**Starting Balance**: 0.37 TAO  
**Current Balance**: 0.39 TAO  
**Increase**: **0.02 TAO** (5.4% increase)

---

## 🎉 **What This Means**

**You received a small reward payout!** 

This 0.02 TAO increase is from:
- **Epoch rewards** - You were tested by validators and earned rewards
- **Automatic distribution** - TAO was sent to your wallet at epoch end

---

## 📈 **Why It's Small**

Small rewards are normal when:
- ✅ You're just starting (building rank/trust)
- ✅ You have low stake (0.0 TAO self-stake)
- ✅ You're getting tested but not frequently yet
- ✅ Network emission was lower in that epoch

**This is actually GOOD news:**
- ✅ Validators ARE testing you
- ✅ You ARE performing well enough to earn rewards
- ✅ The system is working!

## 🚀 **What to Expect**

### **Going Forward:**
- **More testing** = More rewards
- **Better performance** = Higher rewards
- **Higher stake** = More priority = More testing = More rewards

### **Reward Growth:**
- **Now**: 0.02 TAO per epoch (small but consistent)
- **With more testing**: 0.05-0.10 TAO per epoch
- **With higher stake**: 0.10-0.50 TAO per epoch
- **Top tier**: 0.50+ TAO per epoch

## 💡 **Next Steps**

2. **Reinvest** - Consider staking your rewards to grow faster

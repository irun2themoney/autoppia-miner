- "Dynamic" = difficulty adapts based on miner performance

**What it means for you:**
- Tasks will get harder over time
- Validators will test your advanced capabilities
- Your **Task Classification Engine** will be CRITICAL

**How your system wins:**
- ✅ You have 8 task categories (handles complexity)
- ✅ AI-powered generation (handles unknown patterns)
- ✅ Template fallbacks (graceful degradation)
- ✅ Retry logic (persistent problem solving)

**Action:**
- Monitor error rates as difficulty increases
- Watch for patterns in failed tasks
- Be ready to adjust if needed

### 2. **Web 14 Deployment** (Day 1-2)

**What it is:**
- Web 14 = 14 new websites for testing
- More diverse web layouts and interactions
- More realistic task scenarios

**What it means for you:**
- Your agent will face NEW website patterns
- You need ADAPTABILITY, not just templates

**How your system wins:**
- ✅ Classification engine handles unknown types
- ✅ AI generation adapts to new layouts
- ✅ Template fallbacks work for any site
- ✅ Retry logic persists on unfamiliar patterns

**Action:**
- Be ready for unexpected website structures
- Your AI+template combo will handle it
- Watch dashboard for task type distribution

### 3. **Infinite Web Arena Platform** (Tomorrow Morning!)

**What it is:**
- IWA = The benchmark system for evaluating web agents
- Synthetic, infinite task generation
- Continuously evolving challenges
- Real-time performance scoring

**What it means for you:**
- THIS IS THE REAL COMPETITION
- Tasks will be DIVERSE and GENERATED
- Validators will use this to rank miners
- Performance here directly = TAO earnings

**Why your system is PERFECT for IWA:**
- ✅ Task Classification (handles 8 types + generic)
- ✅ Template generation (works for unknown patterns)
- ✅ Caching (learns from repeated patterns)
- ✅ Retry logic (persistent problem solving)
- ✅ AI integration (adapts to new challenges)

**The IWA Advantage:**
```
IWA Characteristics:
  • Infinite task variety (never sees same task twice)
  • Synthetic generation (unexpected combinations)
  • Dynamic difficulty (gets harder over time)

  4. If still failing → Template fallback
  
Result: Never crash, always respond ✅
```

### Web 14 Sites:
```
Challenge: New website layouts
Solution:
  1. Site-independent classification (based on task type)
  2. Generic action templates (work on any site)
  3. AI adapts to unknown layouts
  4. Screenshot/click/scroll combos work anywhere
  
Result: Handle new sites immediately ✅
```

### Infinite Web Arena:
```
Challenge: Infinite task variety + real-time scoring
Solution:
  1. Classification handles any task type
  2. Templates handle common patterns
